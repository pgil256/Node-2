
Bugs:

   1. Patch usernames requires admin token for user update
   2. AuthUser needs to verify user token
   3. GetAll should not require username/password
   4.  Get root route should not return email or phone number
   5.  Patch route should not allow user to update username or password
   6.  Patch route should prevent non-admin from setting themselves admin
